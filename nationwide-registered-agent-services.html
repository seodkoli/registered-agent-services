<p>In United States business law, a signed up representative (also called a resident representative, legal agent, or representative for service of process) is an organization or specific designated to obtain service of procedure (SOP) when a service entity is a celebration in a lawsuit such as a claim or summons. The registered representative&#39;s address may additionally be where the state sends the documents for the regular renewal of business entity&#39;s charter (if needed). The registered agent for a service entity might be a policeman or employee of the business, or a third party, such as the company&#39;s attorney or a service firm. Failing to correctly keep a registered agent can impact a business negatively.</p>

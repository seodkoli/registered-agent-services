<p>In United States organization law, a registered representative (also referred to as a resident agent, statutory representative, or representative for service of procedure) is a company or individual designated to receive service of procedure (SOP) when a company entity is an event in a legal action such as a legal action or summons. The signed up representative&#39;s address might also be where the state sends out the documents for the regular renewal of business entity&#39;s charter (if needed). The signed up agent for an organization entity may be a policeman or worker of the firm, or a third party, such as the organization&#39;s lawyer or a solution company. Failure to appropriately keep a signed up representative can impact a business negatively.</p>

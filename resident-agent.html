<p>In USA organization law, a signed up representative (additionally referred to as a resident representative, legal agent, or representative for service of process) is a company or individual marked to obtain service of process (SOP) when a service entity is a celebration in a lawsuit such as a claim or summons. The signed up representative&#39;s address may likewise be where the state sends the documents for the routine revival of the business entity&#39;s charter (if called for). The signed up agent for a service entity might be a police officer or worker of the firm, or a third party, such as the company&#39;s legal representative or a solution firm. Failing to correctly maintain a signed up agent can affect a business adversely.</p>

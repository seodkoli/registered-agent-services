<p>In USA business regulation, a registered agent (likewise called a resident agent, statutory agent, or agent for solution of process) is a business or individual assigned to get service of process (SOP) when a business entity is a celebration in a legal action such as a claim or summons. The signed up agent&#39;s address might likewise be where the state sends out the paperwork for the regular renewal of the business entity&#39;s charter (if required). The signed up agent for a service entity might be a policeman or worker of the company, or a 3rd party, such as the organization&#39;s lawyer or a solution business. Failing to effectively keep a registered representative can influence a firm adversely.</p>

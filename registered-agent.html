<p>In United States company legislation, a registered agent (additionally referred to as a resident representative, statutory agent, or representative for solution of process) is a business or private designated to get service of process (SOP) when a service entity is a celebration in a lawsuit such as a suit or summons. The registered agent&#39;s address may also be where the state sends out the documents for the routine renewal of the business entity&#39;s charter (if required). The signed up representative for a service entity may be an officer or worker of the firm, or a third party, such as the company&#39;s attorney or a solution business. Failing to effectively keep a registered representative can impact a firm adversely.</p>

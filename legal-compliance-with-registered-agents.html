<p>In United States organization legislation, a signed up agent (likewise referred to as a resident agent, statutory agent, or agent for solution of process) is a company or private designated to get service of procedure (SOP) when an organization entity is a celebration in a lawsuit such as a claim or summons. The registered agent&#39;s address may likewise be where the state sends the paperwork for the routine revival of business entity&#39;s charter (if required). The signed up agent for a business entity may be a policeman or worker of the firm, or a third party, such as the organization&#39;s lawyer or a solution firm.

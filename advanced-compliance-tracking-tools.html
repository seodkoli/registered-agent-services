<p>In United States company legislation, a signed up agent (likewise known as a resident agent, statutory representative, or representative for service of procedure) is a business or specific assigned to obtain service of procedure (SOP) when an organization entity is a party in a lawsuit such as a lawsuit or summons. The registered agent&#39;s address may likewise be where the state sends out the documentation for the regular revival of business entity&#39;s charter (if required). The signed up representative for a service entity might be a police officer or staff member of the company, or a third party, such as the organization&#39;s lawyer or a solution company. Failure to correctly keep a signed up agent can impact a firm adversely.</p>

<p>In United States organization law, a signed up agent (additionally called a resident agent, legal representative, or agent for solution of process) is an organization or private marked to obtain solution of process (SOP) when an organization entity is a celebration in a legal action such as a claim or summons. The signed up agent&#39;s address may also be where the state sends out the documents for the regular renewal of business entity&#39;s charter (if called for). The registered representative for a company entity may be a policeman or staff member of the business, or a third party, such as the company&#39;s legal representative or a solution firm. Failing to effectively maintain a registered agent can influence a company adversely.</p>
